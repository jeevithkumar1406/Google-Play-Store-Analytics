##  📊 Google-Play-Store-Analytics
Google Play Store Analytics analyzes apps using Python, Pandas, and Plotly. It provides time-based interactive dashboards with grouped bar, choropleth, dual-axis, time series, and bubble charts. Filters like installs, reviews, sentiment, and size ensure meaningful insights for app market performance.

## 🎯 Objectives  
The main objective is to create **filtered, time-aware visualizations** for app analytics. Key tasks include:  
- Grouped bar chart for comparing ratings and reviews.  
- Choropleth map for global installs.  
- Dual-axis chart for installs vs. revenue.  
- Time series chart for tracking installs over time.  
- Bubble chart for analyzing size vs. rating with installs as bubble size.  

Each visualization is displayed **only in specific IST time slots**, ensuring the dashboard is dynamic, context-aware, and user-focused.
